# Game 21

## Overview

A simple game written in C++\
Your goal is to reach the number 21 with your cards or be as close to this value as possible. However, this is not a blackjack. In this game there is only one deck, with cards numbered from 1 to 11. There is a fairly simple dealer (perhaps in the future he will be more clever), a system of balance and betting, taking cards and skipping moves (aka folds). Once your balance drops to 0, your game is over. You are not limited in the starting balance, nor in the bet (the only thing is that the bet cannot be bigger than your balance).

## How do I install it?

This is a code repository and might not look like other software that you're used to downloading and installing (if you're not familiar with programming). To download a ready-to-use version of the application, navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/djo-528-1/Game-21/releases), find the most recent release (ex. v.1.0), click "Assets" and download the .zip file with a name that starts with "game-21-build". Unzip this file, then run "game-21.exe". The game should then start normally.

## How do I use it?

All interaction takes place in the terminal (console). For convenience, hints are left after the questions (ex. (Y/N)). However, I should clarify some abbreviations.
| Key | Decipherment | Action |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Y | Yes | I think there's no need to explain ;D |
| N | No | I think there's no need to explain ;D |
| T | Take | Take a card from the deck |
| F | Fold | Skip a move |

## Why does the code look like this?

I wrote this so as not to forget C++ and to improve my skills, not to release it as a real product.
